# Atom Smoothed Dark Syntax

Install with apm:

```bash
apm install smoothed-dark-syntax
```

A smoothed dark color syntax theme for Atom which was adapted from Todd Werth’s [original IR_Black TextMate Theme](http://toddwerth.com/2007/03/29/ir_black-the-last-textmate-theme-youll-ever-need/).

Colors were smoothed gently for the eyes.
